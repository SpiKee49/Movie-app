# Movies App
Goal of the project was to design small application, where you would search for movie by title, list of matched movies will be fetched from extrenal API, there should also be custom paggination, in order to cycle the search result pages. By clicking on desired movie, user will be rerouted to dynamic route of movie detail, where he will have an option to store the movie into his favourites.
